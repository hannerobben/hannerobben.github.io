                        <p>For the past 3 years I have applied this professionally by building ASP.NET web applications, where I developed an effective set of back-end as well as front-end tech skills.</p>

                                            <p class="header-text">What?</p>
                                            <p>An interactive library of products and their parts where a product is defined as a 3-level structure: product > subparts > parts (e.g. motorcycle > engine > piston). For the lowest level parts users can access product standards which define the required specifications for that part.</p>
                                            <p>A control panel is available to administrators who can manage products, product structures and product standards. For the product standards, which can be updated, there is a complete version history available including the option to revert to older versions.</p>
                                            <p>Creation of and updates to product standards require confirmation, which results in a multi-layered process of drafting, submission, rejection and implementation involving multiple users.</p>
                                            <p class="header-text">How?</p>
                                            <p>The web application was developed in several iterations where I presented and demoed the application to the client. I wrote back-end as well as front-end code and I had creative freedom to design parts of the UI and UX.</p>
                                            <p class="header-text">Challenges?</p>
                                            <p>This project required me to comprehend and implement complex application logic - including database design, data queries and algorithms.</p>
                                            <p>Code efficiency was as especially important on this project as it required complex queries to run on large amounts of data while keeping short loading times.</p>

                                            <p class="header-text">What?</p>
                                            <p>An application to raise faults/defects against a product during the production process. Products are defined as a 3-level structure: product > subparts > parts (e.g. motorcycle > engine > piston). The lowest level parts can be selected in a visual way through markers on a product image, after which a fault/defect can be submitted against that specific part.</p>
                                            <p>A control panel is available to administrators who can manage production processes, products, product structures and faults. Through a visual reporting tool using Chart.js, extensive data on faults can be extracted for analysis.</p>
                                            <p>This application is linked to Logic Tree (see application above).</p>
                                            <p class="header-text">How?</p>
                                            <p>The web application was developed in several iterations where I presented and demoed the application to the client. I worked in close relationship with the client to think of relevant new features and to streamline application processes. I wrote back-end as well as front-end code and I had creative freedom to design parts of the UI and UX.</p>
                                            <p class="header-text">Challenges?</p>
                                            <p>The application required a reporting tool to extract useful data for which I needed to write complex data queries and algorithms and called for smart database design. This data also had to be visualised in a comprehensive way by using the Chart.js library.</p>
                                            <p>I was given a lot of freedom in terms of defining application logic, suggesting new features, designing UI and UX which required an adequate amount of autonomous decision making and critical thinking.</p>

                                            <p>A web application for users to search for the availibility of holiday homes in the UK based on several search parameters.</p>

                                            <p>The application includes a customised CMS and CRM system to manage membership (including many automated processes such as membership application and progression, membership payments, data reporting).</p>

                                            <p>Efficient code was especially important for this project as search results have to be returned as quickly as possible even with complex search queries.</p>
                                            <p>Extra attention had to be paid to UX as the application requires non-technical users to go through complex processes without issues.</p>
